#### Summary

This data set comprises the medical histories of 299 patients diagnosed with heart failure, and the target variable is `death_event`with each patient's profile containing 12 clinical attributes.

#### statistically descriptive analysis

Target:ã€€As the pie plot shows below, our targeted variables `death_event` is unbalance with more survival observation than the dead one.

Quantitative Variables: we visualize 7 quantitative variables with histogram and fit each distribution of them, except \`time\` which has two peaks. The upper four plots comply to gamma distribution and the below to follow normal distribution:
